## Technical Implementation Highlights

### State Management

Single source of truth: `MerchantOnboardingState`

```typescript
{
  currentStep: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4,
  cohort: 'self-serve' | 'assisted' | 'managed',
  signUpData: SignUpFormData,
  posSetupData: POSSetupData,
  checkoutData: CheckoutData,
  bankAccountData: BankAccountData,
  kybStatus: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'review' | 'rejected',
  kycStatus: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'review' | 'rejected',
  orderConfirmed: boolean,
  hardwareShipped: boolean,
  paymentsActive: boolean,
  payoutsEnabled: boolean,
  assignedSpecialist?: SpecialistInfo,
  setupTasks: SetupTask[]
}
```

### Form Validation

Real-time validation with helpful error messages:
- Email format validation
- Password strength (min 8 characters)
- Phone number format

- Tax ID format validation

### Animations

Framer Motion used for:
- Page transitions (slide in/out)
- Success celebrations (scale spring)
- Loading spinners
- Progress bar fills
- Checkmark reveals
- Card hover effects
- Expand/collapse sections

### Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 768px (single column, compact progress)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (two columns)
- Desktop: > 1024px (full layout with sidebar)

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`)
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management (auto-focus on first field)
- Color contrast > 4.5:1
- Screen reader friendly

### Cohort Assignment (Step 1)
```javascript
function determineCohort(revenueRange, locationCount) {
  if (revenue >= $2M OR locations >= 10) ‚Üí managed
  if (revenue >= $500K OR locations >= 3) ‚Üí assisted
  else ‚Üí self-serve
}
```

### Payment Processing (Step 3)
- Delay: 3 seconds
- Success rate: 95%
- Generates order number: #LS-[6 digits]

### Bank Verification (Step 4)

---

### Navigation Testing

- **Back button**: Should preserve form data
- **Browser back/forward**: Should maintain state
- **Page refresh**: State is lost (add persistence in Phase 2)
- **Direct URL**: `/merchant` goes to Step 1

### Responsive Testing

- **Mobile**: `http://localhost:3000/merchant`
  - Test on Chrome DevTools mobile emulation
  - Verify single column layouts
  - Check touch targets (>44px)
  - Test sticky pricing summary

- **Tablet**: Resize to 768px-1024px
  - Two-column forms should appear
  - Sidebar should be sticky

- **Desktop**: Full width
  - Optimal spacing
  - Hover effects work
  - Multi-column layouts

### Browser Testing

Tested on:
- ‚úÖ Chrome 120+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 120+
- ‚úÖ Safari 17+
- ‚úÖ Edge 120+

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Multi-Page Form in Step 1?

**Decision**: Split signup into Account ‚Üí Business Legal ‚Üí Verification

**Reasoning**:
- Reduces cognitive load (smaller chunks)
- Creates sense of progress
- Allows verification step to happen naturally
- Each page has clear focus

### 2. Why Invisible Cohort Assignment?

**Decision**: Don't ask users to choose support level

**Reasoning**:
- Users don't know what they need yet
- System has better information (revenue/locations)
- Removes decision paralysis
- Feels more personalized

### 3. Why Sticky Pricing Summary?

**Decision**: Keep pricing visible during configuration

**Reasoning**:
- Transparency builds trust
- Reduces checkout abandonment
- Users can see impact of choices
- No surprise costs at checkout

### 4. Why Expandable Tasks in Step 4?

**Decision**: Collapsible cards with instructions

**Reasoning**:
- Shows progress at a glance
- Doesn't overwhelm with details
- Instructions available when needed
- Works well on mobile

### 5. Why Simulate Backend Operations?

**Decision**: Add realistic delays (2-3s) with loading states

**Reasoning**:
- Demonstrates production behavior
- Tests loading state UX
- Shows backend integration points
- Realistic demo experience

## Known Limitations (For Demo)

1. **No data persistence**: Page refresh loses state
2. **No real API calls**: All backend operations simulated
3. **No email notifications**: Would trigger in production
4. **No error recovery**: Happy path only
5. **Limited validation**: Basic checks only
6. **Mock hardware images**: Placeholder graphics
7. **No document upload**: Would be needed for review cases
8. **No payment tokenization**: Using fake card numbers
9. **No bank micro-deposits**: Instant verification

These would be implemented in Phase 2 (Real Integration).

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@radix-ui/react-checkbox": "^1.3.3",
  "@radix-ui/react-label": "^2.1.7",
  "@radix-ui/react-select": "^2.2.6"
}
```

Existing dependencies used:
- @radix-ui/react-progress
- @radix-ui/react-separator
- @radix-ui/react-slot
- @radix-ui/react-tabs
- framer-motion
- lucide-react
- next, react, react-dom
- tailwindcss

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**Issue**: TypeScript errors about 'any' types

**Solution**: Some linting rules are strict. The code compiles successfully. Disable specific rules if needed in `eslint.config.mjs`.

**Issue**: Module not found errors

**Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

### Runtime Errors

**Issue**: Form not submitting

**Solution**: Check browser console for validation errors. All required fields must be filled.

**Issue**: Animations not smooth

**Solution**: Ensure browser supports modern JS. Try in latest Chrome/Firefox.

**Issue**: Specialist card not showing

**Solution**: Only appears for assisted/managed cohorts. Use higher revenue/location values in Step 1.
