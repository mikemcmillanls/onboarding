### 3. Product Documentation (/product)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- **`cohort-thresholds.md`**
  - **Self-Serve:** GTV <$500K, 1-3 locations, standard verticals
  - **Assisted:** GTV $500K-$2M, 3-10 locations, moderate complexity
  - **Managed:** GTV >$2M, 10+ locations, enterprise verticals
  - Complexity scoring model (vertical + integrations + add-ons)
  - Edge case handling and manual override rules

- **`intervention-triggers.md`**
  - **Time-based triggers:** 3 days stalled = alert, 7 days = escalation
  - **Attempt-based triggers:** 2 failed KYB = IC review, 3 failed = reject
  - Auto-escalation rules (Self-Serve → IC after 5 days)
  - Win-back campaign triggers (abandoned for 14 days)

- **`ae-sla-strategy.md`**
  - **Recommendation:** Target 2-hour response time (not 15 minutes for MVP)
  - Business hours: M-F 8am-8pm ET
  - Fallback: Schedule callback if AE unavailable
  - Capacity model: 8-10 new leads per AE per day

- **`ic-pricing-model.md`**
  - **Free IC support:** Included for Assisted cohort, basic setup help
  - **Paid implementation:** $2,500-$10,000 based on location count
  - Pricing tiers: 1-5 locations ($2,500), 6-15 ($5,000), 16+ ($10,000)
  - Includes: dedicated IC, data migration, training, 30-day post-launch support

- **`trial-vs-buy.md`**
  - **Recommendation for MVP:** Buy-first approach (no trial)
  - Rationale: Reduces friction, qualifies serious buyers
  - Future consideration: Limited trial for high-GTV prospects
  - 30-day money-back guarantee as risk mitigation

**Key Decisions:**
- Simplified cohort thresholds for Phase 1 (refine based on data)
- Realistic AE SLA (2 hours vs. aspirational 15 minutes)
- Clear IC pricing model (transparent, value-based)
- Buy-first to streamline MVP (trial adds complexity)

### 4. Design Documentation (/design)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

- **`design-system.md`**
  - Color palette based on shadcn/ui defaults
  - Typography scale (Inter font family)
  - 8px spacing grid
  - Component library: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
  - Responsive breakpoints (mobile: 640px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px)
  - Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **`merchant-dashboard-wireframes.md`**
  - 10-step progress indicator design
  - Step-by-step flow wireframes:
    - Account creation form (Step 2)
    - KYB qualification (Step 3)
    - License builder (Step 4)
    - Hardware selection (Step 5)
    - Quote & payment checkout (Step 6)

  - AE dashboard: queue view, merchant details, quote builder
  - IC dashboard: queue view, session scheduler, progress tracker
  - Alert/notification patterns
  - Communication log interface

- **`flow-variations.md`**
  - Self-Serve path: fully automated, self-guided
  - Assisted path: hybrid (AE quote + self-checkout)
  - Managed path: AE-driven (negotiated pricing)
  - Transition points between paths

**Key Decisions:**
- Next.js + shadcn/ui for rapid development
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Progressive disclosure for complex forms
- Inline validation with helpful error messages

## Critical Architecture Requirements

### 1. KYB Before Hardware Purchase
- Step 3 (KYB) MUST complete before Step 5 (hardware ordering)
- Prevents shipping to ineligible merchants
- Enforced in Onboarding Orchestrator workflow

### 2. Payouts Held Until Bank Verification
- Step 7 activates Payments but holds payouts
- Step 9 collects bank account and enables payouts
- Enforced in Payments Service integration

### 3. Cohort-Specific Paths
- Routing Logic assigns correct selling and setup plans
- Dashboard adapts UI based on cohort
- AE/IC queues prioritize high-GTV leads
