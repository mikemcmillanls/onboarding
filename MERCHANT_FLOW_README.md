# Simplified 4-Step Merchant Onboarding Flow

## Overview

This is a complete rebuild of the merchant-facing onboarding UI based on the **revised PRD** (`merchant_onboarding_prd_revised.md`). The new flow simplifies the merchant experience from 10 steps to just **4 intuitive steps** while maintaining sophisticated backend intelligence.

## Key Features

### 1. Merchant-First Design
- **Simple progression**: Sign Up → Configure → Purchase → Setup
- **Invisible cohort routing**: System automatically determines support level based on revenue and location count
- **Progressive disclosure**: Shows only relevant information at each step
- **Mobile-first responsive design**: Works seamlessly on all devices

### 2. Intelligent Cohort Management
The system automatically assigns merchants to the right experience level:

| Cohort | Revenue | Locations | Experience |
|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Self-Serve** | <$500K | 1-3 | Fully automated with optional support |
| **Assisted** | $500K-$2M | 3-10 | Specialist contacts merchant proactively |
| **Managed** | $2M+ | 10+ | Dedicated account manager with custom pricing |

### 3. Modern UX Patterns
- **Real-time validation** with helpful error messages
- **Smooth animations** using Framer Motion
- **Loading states** for async operations (KYB/KYC verification)
- **Success celebrations** with animated checkmarks
- **Sticky pricing summary** that updates in real-time

### 4. Backend Intelligence (Simulated)
- **KYB verification** during Step 1 (auto-approval simulation)
- **KYC verification** during Step 3 (identity check)
- **Cohort assignment** based on business profile
- **Specialist routing** for assisted/managed cohorts
- **Progressive activation** (payments active, payouts held until bank verification)

## Architecture

### File Structure

```
/app/merchant/page.tsx                    # Main onboarding flow controller
/components/merchant/
  ├── step-progress.tsx                   # 4-step progress indicator
  ├── step1-signup.tsx                    # Sign up & business info (multi-page)
  ├── step2-pos-setup.tsx                 # POS config & hardware selection
  ├── step3-checkout.tsx                  # Payment & identity verification
  └── step4-setup.tsx                     # Task checklist for final setup
/types/merchant-onboarding.ts             # TypeScript definitions
/lib/merchant-mock-data.ts                # Constants, mock data, and utilities
```

### State Management

The main controller (`/app/merchant/page.tsx`) manages a single `MerchantOnboardingState` object that includes:

```typescript
{
  currentStep: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4,
  cohort: 'self-serve' | 'assisted' | 'managed',
  signUpData: { /* Step 1 data */ },
  posSetupData: { /* Step 2 data */ },
  checkoutData: { /* Step 3 data */ },
  kybStatus: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'review' | 'rejected',
  kycStatus: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'review' | 'rejected',
  assignedSpecialist?: { name, role, phone, email },
  // ... other status flags
}
```

### Data Flow

```
Step 1: Signup
  → Collect account + business info
  → Simulate KYB verification (2s delay)
  → Assign cohort based on revenue/locations
  → Assign specialist if assisted/managed
  → Navigate to Step 2

Step 2: POS Setup
  → Configure locations, registers, eCommerce
  → Select hardware bundles (filtered by business category)
  → Calculate real-time pricing
  → Show specialist banner for assisted/managed
  → Navigate to Step 3

Step 3: Checkout
  → Payment information (credit card)
  → Billing/shipping addresses
  → Identity verification (KYC data)
  → Simulate payment processing (3s delay)
  → Show order confirmation with next steps
  → Navigate to Step 4

Step 4: Setup Tasks
  → Expandable task checklist
  → Mark tasks complete interactively
  → Bank account connection form (embedded)
  → Show specialist help options for assisted/managed
  → Complete when all required tasks done
```

- Primary: `blue-600` to `purple-600`
- Success: `green-600`
- Warning: `orange-600`
- Muted: `slate-400`

Update in `tailwind.config.js` for global changes.

### Adjusting Cohort Thresholds

Edit `/lib/merchant-mock-data.ts`:

```typescript
export function determineCohort(revenueRange: string, locationCount: number) {
  // Adjust these thresholds:
  if (minRevenue >= 2000000 || locationCount >= 10) return 'managed';
  if (minRevenue >= 500000 || locationCount >= 3) return 'assisted';
  return 'self-serve';
}
```

### Adding New Hardware Bundles

Edit `/lib/merchant-mock-data.ts`:

```typescript
export const HARDWARE_BUNDLES: HardwareBundle[] = [
  {
    id: 'custom-bundle',
    name: 'Custom Bundle Name',
    description: 'Short description',
    items: ['Item 1', 'Item 2'],
    price: 1999,
    image: '/path/to/image.jpg',
    recommendedFor: ['retail', 'restaurant'],
  },
  // ... more bundles
];
```

### Modifying Setup Tasks

Edit `/lib/merchant-mock-data.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_SETUP_TASKS: SetupTask[] = [
  {
    id: 'new-task',
    title: 'New Task Title',
    description: 'Brief description',
    completed: false,
    required: true, // or false for optional
    instructions: 'Detailed step-by-step instructions...',
  },
  // ... more tasks
];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Forms not submitting
**Solution**: Check browser console for validation errors. Ensure all required fields are filled.

### Issue: Progress not advancing
**Solution**: Look for error states. Some steps require successful "backend" operations (simulated delays).

### Issue: Specialist card not showing
**Solution**: Only appears for assisted/managed cohorts. Try higher revenue/location counts in Step 1.

### Issue: Animations not working
**Solution**: Ensure Framer Motion is installed and browser supports modern JS.
